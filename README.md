# Renewable sponges

A simple Minecraft mod that adds sponges to the fishing loot table.

The weight in the table is 12 (0.12 in the config) by default, but can be configured in the settings.

It is technically not needed client-side if you join a server with this mod.

By default, WET_SPONGE is added to the loot table, but it can be configured to SPONGE in the mod's configuration.

Pairs well with my other mod [Water Resistance Potion](https://modrinth.com/mod/water-resistance-potion) that adds a potion which defaults to using sponges as an ingredient.
